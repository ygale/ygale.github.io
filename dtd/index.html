<h2>Processing XML DTDs in Haskell</h2>
<p>
  The following packages, available on
  <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/packages">
  Hackage</a>, relate to XML Document Type Declarations (DTD) as defined
  in
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/#Publications">
  W3C specifications</a>:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dtd-types" >
    dtd-types</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This package provides types to represent a DTD.
      It is intended to be compatible with
      and extend the set of types in <em>Data.XML.Types</em>
      provided by the
      <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-types">xml-types</a>
      package.
    </p><p>
      Following the philosophy of <em>Data.XML.Types</em>,
      the types in this module are not intended to be a strict and
      complete representation of the model in the W3C specifications;
      rather, they are intended to be convenient and type-safe for the
      kinds of processing of DTDs that are commonly done in
      practice. As such, this model is compatible with both Version
      1.0 and Version 1.1 of the XML specification.
    </p><p>
      Therefore, these types are not suitable for type-level
      validation of the syntax of a DTD. For example: these types are
      more lenient than the specs about the characters that are
      allowed in various locations in a DTD; entities of various kinds
      only appear as distinct syntactic elements in places where they
      are commonly needed when processing DTDs; etc.
    </p><p>
      Conditional sections are not represented in these types. They
      should be handled directly by parsers and renderers, if needed.

      This package provides a parser and renderer for XML DTDs. It implements
      most of the parts of the W3C XML specification relating to DTDs.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Parser</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The parser is based on
          <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec-text">
          attoparsec-text</a>. Parsers are provided for all of the
          semantically important components of a DTD, and for the
          entire DTD itself. In addition, several functions are provided that
          parse the DTD while performing resolution of parameter entities.
        </p><p>
          The results of the parsers are Haskell DTD objects from the
          <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dtd-types">dtd-types</a>
          package.
        </p><dl>
          <dt>Synopsis:</dt>
          <dd>
            <pre>
          -- Parse a DTD without parameter entity resolution.
          -- See the attoparsec-text package for information
          -- about how to use this parser.
          dtd :: Parse DTD

          -- Parse a DTD from a Data.Text.Lazy while resolving
          -- references to internal parameter entities. If you
          -- are not sure which interface to use, use this one.
          dtdParse :: L.Text -> DTD

          -- Parse a DTD from a Data.Text.Lazy while resolving
          -- references to internal and external parameter entities.
          dtdParseWithExtern :: SymTable -> L.Text -> DTD

          -- where type SymTable = M.Map Text L.Text
            </pre>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          This parser does not attempt to go out
          and fetch the values of external references for you from files
          and URLs. You need to fetch them yourself and provide them to
          the parser in a <em>SymTable</em>.
        </p><p>
          If you need to extract information, such as system IDs and
          public IDs, from the DTD before you fetch external values,
          you might be able to get them by applying parseDTD to all or
          part of the DTD as an initial parse. The parser tries very hard
          to give partial results when things are missing, while still doing
          its best to avoid problems like looping references.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Renderer</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The renderer is based on the
          <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-builder">
          blaze-builder</a> package. Renderers are provided for all of the
          semantically important components of a DTD, and for the
          entire DTD itself.
        </p><p>
          The builders take as input Haskell DTD objects from the
          <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dtd-types">dtd-types</a>
          package.
        </p><p>
          See the
          <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-builder">
          blaze-builder</a> package for information about how to use
          these builders.
        </p>

      <strong>Note:</strong>
      The current version of dtd-text does not support
      conditional sections.
